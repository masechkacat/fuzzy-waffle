# Welcome to the todo-app

This application will be used as a test where you will have to add a few things:

## Installation

A simple `npm install` will install all the dependencies needed to run the application.

To run the application you can use the following commands: `npm run json` and `npm run dev` (in two separate terminals).

## Tasks

### Features

1. Add a new urgency level to the tasks. The urgency level should be named "now" and have a violet color.
2. Have the urgency colored tag on the left of the line, absolutely positioned so that it slightly gets out of the card.
3. Add a toggle-all and a delete-all button to the top right of the list.
4. Add the following new component:

- contains a card
- has the title "Filter todos"
- has a text input to filter the todos by name
- has a select input to filter the todos by urgency level
- has a button to clear the filters
- when there aren't any filters applied, we shouldn't return any todos
