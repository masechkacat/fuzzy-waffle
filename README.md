# ‚úå Welcome to the todo-app

This React application will be used as a test where you will have to add a few things:

 ## üõ† Installation

A simple `npm install` will install all the dependencies needed to run the application.

To run the application you can use the following commands: `npm run json` and `npm run dev` (in two separate terminals).

## üìù Tasks 

1. Add a new urgency level to the tasks. The urgency level should be named "now" and have a violet color.
2. Have the urgency colored tag on the left of the line, absolutely positioned so that it slightly gets out of the card.
3. Add a toggle-all and a delete-all button to the top right of the list.
4. Add the following new component:

   - *Contains a **card**.*
   - *Has the title `Filter todos`.*
   - *Has a **text input** to filter the todos by name.*
   - *Has a **select input** to filter the todos by urgency level.*
   - *Has a **button** to clear the filters.*
   - *When there aren't any filters applied, no todos should be returned.*

## ü§ì Tips

- This project uses **React 18.3.1**. The official documentation can be found [here](https://react.dev/).
- A **mock server** has been set up that simulates a REST API. **It does not need to be modified**.
- We are using [**TanStack Query**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (formerly React Query) for API interaction. The related hooks can be found in `src/queries/useTodos.ts`.
- For UI components, we are using [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [**Chadcn**](https://ui.shadcn.dev/). Components are located in `src/components/ui`, and all necessary components are available, so no additional installations are required.
- The project is built using [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/), and **`npm`** is used for managing dependencies and running scripts.
